The Difficulty of Being Good: On the Subtle Art of Dharma by Gurcharan Das is not just a book about an ancient epic. It is also a book about the contemporary world and the moral questions that we face every day. How do we balance our personal and professional lives? How do we deal with corruption and injustice? How do we cope with loss and suffering? How do we make decisions when there are no clear-cut answers?
 
The book draws insights from the Mahabharata, which is considered one of the longest and most complex literary works in the world. The Mahabharata tells the story of a dynastic war between two sets of cousins, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, who fight for the throne of Hastinapura. Along the way, the characters encounter various situations and dilemmas that test their character and values. The book focuses on some of the key episodes and characters of the epic, such as the game of dice, the exile of the Pandavas, the Bhagavad Gita, Draupadi, Yudhishthira, Arjuna, Krishna, Duryodhana, Karna, and Bhishma.
 
The book also relates the lessons and themes of the Mahabharata to modern examples and scenarios. The author uses his own personal and professional experiences as well as stories from history, politics, business, literature, and philosophy to illustrate how dharma can be understood and applied in different contexts. The book challenges us to reflect on our own actions and choices and to question our assumptions and prejudices. The book invites us to discover the subtle art of dharma and to strive for being good in a difficult world.
